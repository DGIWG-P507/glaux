# Glaux Server pre-implementation review

**Status: in progress.** This is the shared record for finishing the existing review across Copilot and other AI providers. A provider change resumes the saved work; it does not restart the review.

[Planning documents](../README.md) · [Findings and current assessment](findings.md) · [Review instructions](instructions.md) · [Coverage and handoff state](review-state.json) · [Evidence manifest](evidence/source-manifest.json)

## Start here

1. Read the current assessment in **findings.md**.
2. Read **instructions.md**, especially the rule for recording disagreements without interrupting coverage.
3. Use **current_work** in **review-state.json** to resume the exact unfinished step or next batch. Do not reload every archived response.

The last substantive reviewer response is **Pass 3c, iteration 17**, which closed the second slice of the research deep-read remainders: IDR-040 Sections 9-21, accounted for against Guide v1.3. That report's invariants are substantially adopted in the Guide's own vocabulary, and its typed policy machinery is a recorded scope choice rather than a defect. One evidenced gap was found and recorded under F-03: the Guide binds cursors, subscriptions and queued decisions to their authorization bounds but states no rule binding a response cache validator or cache key to the authorized view, which leaves both a concealed-change inference channel and a cross-caller reuse risk in the trusted-proxy deployments it supports. No new finding number; one new follow-up question. The earlier iteration 16 (the handoff from GitHub Copilot) corrected the issue-read bookkeeping for #98, #99 and #130 and closed slice 1 across IDR-008, IDR-037, IDR-038 and IDR-039.

The record has **22 finding IDs, including two withdrawals**, with subsequent qualifications preserved. No standards check is outstanding, and **18 of 286** issue bodies are documented as read.

The next selected batch is the third slice: **IDR-042's unread sections** (3-4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19-20, about 380 lines). IDR-042 and IDR-043 were split across two slices because their combined remainder is roughly 1,000 lines. After those, the remaining scope is the four committed deep reads not yet begun (IDR-030, IDR-034, IDR-039A, IDR-055). The machine state is authoritative for that cursor as review continues.

## What lives here

| File or directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [findings.md](findings.md) | Authoritative finding dispositions, current assessment, evidence and implementation implications |
| [instructions.md](instructions.md) | Bounded iterations, independent review, disagreement handling, publication and provider handoff |
| [review-state.json](review-state.json) | Reading versus review coverage, unresolved checks, active cursor and batch history; no duplicate finding text |
| [evidence/](evidence/) | Archived responses and historical instructions, clearly separate from active instructions |
| [evidence/source-manifest.json](evidence/source-manifest.json) | Provenance, original/published hashes and privacy transformations |

This is review working material, not a replacement Goal, Implementation Guide, Roadmap or research program. Changes suggested by the review are not approved merely by appearing here.

## Completion criteria

The purpose is to finish the review, not maintain an endless reading queue. Reuse existing work; a section already reviewed does not require another read because a pass number or AI provider changes.

| Original area | Current position | Finish condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Baseline/planning documents | Completed at the recorded baseline | Reuse it; check relevant subsequent changes only |
| 2. Standards | Complete for the carried checks: six carried groups closed (SWE quality, array flags, Features Part 3/CQL2 identifiers, SensorML class identifiers, IDR-011 Section 14.3 abstract-test rows, Part 2 Annex A.1 inheritance) and the F-13 extension question resolved | Met; later passes may raise targeted standards questions, each recorded in `remaining_checks` with evidence |
| 3. Research and peer evidence | Partially complete; deep-read remainders slices 1-2 closed (IDR-008, IDR-037, IDR-038, IDR-039 remainders and IDR-040 Sections 9-21; all five now fully read); next slice selected (IDR-042's unread sections, then IDR-043's) | Account for key findings/recommendations/open questions across 71 reports, finish consequential committed deep reads (IDR-030, 034, 039A, 055) and remaining pinned CS-GO/OSH checks; not blanket full reads of every plan/report |
| 4. End-to-end scenarios | Selected analysis exists | Account for the approved capability workflows and consequential failures/security/provenance boundaries |
| 5. Verification quality | Selected checks exist | Assess independent expected answers, meaningful failure detection and appropriate real-system checks across the planned capabilities |
| 6. Implementation issues | 18 of 286 bodies documented as read; targeted reviews only | Account for all issue-specific scope/acceptance checks and the complete dependency/coverage/sizing analysis; deduplicate identical boilerplate |
| Final assessment | Not complete | Publish supported findings, withdrawals, bounded uncertainties, coverage accounting and implementation advice |

These are coverage criteria, not a prediction of cost or iterations. An explicitly agreed scope exception must remain visible. A subscription limit produces a checkpoint, not a false completion declaration.

A finding can finish as supported, withdrawn, optional or explicitly unresolved with a documented consequence. The review does **not** need every recommendation implemented or every uncertainty eliminated to finish.

## Using the outcome

The final assessment must distinguish:

- Actions needed before initial implementation work.
- Decisions or fixes needed before a named later issue or milestone.
- Optional improvements.
- Remaining uncertainty and coverage limits.

Keep those recommendations tied to existing Guide/Roadmap/issue owners. Do not turn every finding into a new blanket prerequisite, a new project, or another research cycle.

## Cross-provider continuation

Give the next reviewer this folder's URL and say:

> Read README.md, instructions.md and the current findings. Resume current_work from review-state.json for one authorized iteration. Record disagreements and continue substantive coverage. Update and publish this review checkpoint before handing back.

The provider/model and actual evidence should be recorded when known. Unknown model names stay unknown. Repository commits are the durable handoff; private model memory and old ZIP exports are not the authority.
