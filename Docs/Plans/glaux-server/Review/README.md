# Glaux Server pre-implementation review

**Status: in progress.** This is the shared record for finishing the existing review across Copilot and other AI providers. A provider change resumes the saved work; it does not restart the review.

[Planning documents](../README.md) · [Findings and current assessment](findings.md) · [Review instructions](instructions.md) · [Coverage and handoff state](review-state.json) · [Evidence manifest](evidence/source-manifest.json)

## Start here

1. Read the current assessment in **findings.md**.
2. Read **instructions.md**, especially the rule for recording disagreements without interrupting coverage.
3. Use **current_work** in **review-state.json** to resume the exact unfinished step or next batch. Do not reload every archived response.

The last substantive reviewer response is **Copilot Pass 3c, iteration 11**. The imported record has **22 finding IDs, including two withdrawals**, with subsequent qualifications preserved. The documentation-organization work has not performed another technical-review pass.

The next selected batch is the two carried SWE questions: quality schema/semantics and array-flag interpretation. The machine state is authoritative for that cursor as review continues.

## What lives here

| File or directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [findings.md](findings.md) | Authoritative finding dispositions, current assessment, evidence and implementation implications |
| [instructions.md](instructions.md) | Bounded iterations, independent review, disagreement handling, publication and provider handoff |
| [review-state.json](review-state.json) | Reading versus review coverage, unresolved checks, active cursor and batch history; no duplicate finding text |
| [evidence/](evidence/) | Archived responses and historical instructions, clearly separate from active instructions |
| [evidence/source-manifest.json](evidence/source-manifest.json) | Provenance, original/published hashes and privacy transformations |

This is review working material, not a replacement Goal, Implementation Guide, Roadmap or research program. Changes suggested by the review are not approved merely by appearing here.

## Completion criteria

The purpose is to finish the review, not maintain an endless reading queue. Reuse existing work; a section already reviewed does not require another read because a pass number or AI provider changes.

| Original area | Current position | Finish condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Baseline/planning documents | Completed at the recorded baseline | Reuse it; check relevant subsequent changes only |
| 2. Standards | Partially complete | Resolve the six carried standards groups and F-13 extension question with evidence or a stated bounded unresolved result |
| 3. Research and peer evidence | Partially complete | Account for key findings/recommendations/open questions across 71 reports, finish consequential committed deep reads and remaining pinned CS-GO/OSH checks; not blanket full reads of every plan/report |
| 4. End-to-end scenarios | Selected analysis exists | Account for the approved capability workflows and consequential failures/security/provenance boundaries |
| 5. Verification quality | Selected checks exist | Assess independent expected answers, meaningful failure detection and appropriate real-system checks across the planned capabilities |
| 6. Implementation issues | 15 of 286 bodies documented as read; targeted reviews only | Account for all issue-specific scope/acceptance checks and the complete dependency/coverage/sizing analysis; deduplicate identical boilerplate |
| Final assessment | Not complete | Publish supported findings, withdrawals, bounded uncertainties, coverage accounting and implementation advice |

These are coverage criteria, not a prediction of cost or iterations. An explicitly agreed scope exception must remain visible. A subscription limit produces a checkpoint, not a false completion declaration.

A finding can finish as supported, withdrawn, optional or explicitly unresolved with a documented consequence. The review does **not** need every recommendation implemented or every uncertainty eliminated to finish.

## Using the outcome

The final assessment must distinguish:

- Actions needed before initial implementation work.
- Decisions or fixes needed before a named later issue or milestone.
- Optional improvements.
- Remaining uncertainty and coverage limits.

Keep those recommendations tied to existing Guide/Roadmap/issue owners. Do not turn every finding into a new blanket prerequisite, a new project, or another research cycle.

## Cross-provider continuation

Give the next reviewer this folder's URL and say:

> Read README.md, instructions.md and the current findings. Resume current_work from review-state.json for one authorized iteration. Record disagreements and continue substantive coverage. Update and publish this review checkpoint before handing back.

The provider/model and actual evidence should be recorded when known. Unknown model names stay unknown. Repository commits are the durable handoff; private model memory and old ZIP exports are not the authority.
